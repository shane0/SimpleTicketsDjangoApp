# SimpleTicketsDjangoApp
simple django ticket system that emails invoices and has a monthly billing csv export, developed while working at Mercy Hospital

this is basically an out of box django app with a few custom admin actions for email and csv exporting

I hosted this on linux, apache, sqlite using blueprint css framework and minimal templates

The basic function was techs can create, email and export tickets/invocies in the admin interface with a few front facing views fpr reporting

other uses are a basic config management db, cmdb part of documentation for ITIL

I have expanded models for that that include more fields if needed
